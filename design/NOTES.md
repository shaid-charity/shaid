NOTES

To do
-----
- Newsletter signup
- Add facebook feed somewhere
- Events
- Shop
- Need to sort navigation:
	- Both header and footer
	- Neither contain some pages (e.g. 'links.php')
	- Get navigation for header include and footer include from a third file - easier editing


Issues
------
- Downloads > Recruitment Paperwork
	- TBC
- Need to split up CSS files
	- i.e. 'blog.css' is not just blog stuff


To note
-------
- Cookie warning:
	- Should be visible on all pages until dismissal
	- Demo on index.php
- Footer links:
	- Should be:
		- Logged out: 'Log in'
		- Logged in: 'Log out', 'Admin Panel'
- Admin bar:
	- Should be visible on all pages when logged in
	- Add whatever links you think you should add
	- Demo on login.php page
	- If logged in extra padding should be added to '.footer-charityinfo' element so that footer links are still visible
