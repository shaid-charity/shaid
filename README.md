# SHAID

As part of the COMP2252 Software Engineering module at Durham University, students work with local charities and non-profit organisations to develop a software solution that will benefit their day-to-day operations.

We worked with the homeless charity SHAID to design and develop a new website to help them grow their web presence and better reach those in need.
